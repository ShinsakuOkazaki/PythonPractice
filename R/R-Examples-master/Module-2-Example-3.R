# In order to assess how quickly polyester decays over time in landfills, a researcher buried strips of the material in the soil
# for different lengths of time and then tested the force required to break them (as a measure of decay). Lower breaking strength 
# is indicative of decay


# Test whether or not the breaking strengths of polyester strips buried for 2 weeks is greater than the breaking strengths of
# those buried for 16 weeks. 

# Perform the test at the Î±=0.10 level of significance.

# First read the data as a dataframe into your R memory 
decay<- read.csv("Datasets/decay.csv" )

#print the dataframe to check the content
# Note, this is only possible if your data is small 
decay


# Print out a summary of the data for the 2 weeks sample data 
summary(decay$strength[decay$weeks==2])


# Print out a summary of the data for the 16 weeks sample data 
summary(decay$strength[decay$weeks==16])

# read the manual of t-test function 
?t.test 

# Compute the test t statistic and the associated p-value
# Reject H0 if p <= alph, p<=0.1
ttest1 <- t.test(decay$strength[decay$weeks==2], decay$strength[decay$weeks==16], alternative="greater", conf.level=0.9)

print(ttest1)

# Two Sample t-test
ttest2 <- t.test(decay$strength[decay$weeks==2], decay$strength[decay$weeks==16], alternative="two.sided", conf.level=0.95)

print(test2)

# 95 percent confidence interval:
